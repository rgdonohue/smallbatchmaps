## **ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE** 

My teaching and research emphasizes the implementation of emerging technical solutions within spatial data science and web cartography, informed by critique and digital geographies. I teach students  web design to support cartographic interaction, geovisualization, and digital storytelling, as well as GIS and coding solutions for the analysis, wrangling, and transformation of various spatial data sources. I build, instruct, and support online education within graduate-level courses culminating in Certificate and MS degrees in Digital Mapping.
