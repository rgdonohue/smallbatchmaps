## Small Batch Maps

Curated, handcrafted cartography and geospatial intelligence — integrating GIS, AI, and design — by Dr. Richard Donohue.

This is a working portfolio, digital workshop, and creative studio for experimental cartography and geospatial tools — mixing old-school craft with bleeding-edge code.

### Offerings

**🗺️ Web Cartography**
Fast, lightweight, artisanal web maps — optimized for storytelling, exploration, or analysis. Built with MapLibre, Tippecanoe, and modern JS frameworks.

**🧠 Spatial Data Science**
Smarter maps begin with smart data. I integrate advanced spatial analysis, open data pipelines, and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) using Python, PostGIS, and AI tooling.

**🎨 Map Styling & Design Systems**
Maps with a point of view. I craft original basemap styles, cartographic design systems, and intuitive legends — guided by clarity, aesthetics, and ethics.

**🧪 R\&D and Experiments**
Open-ended spatial experiments, tool prototyping, and weird beautiful stuff. Because the future of maps belongs to the curious — to those who chase rabbits down data trails, question the obvious, and redraw boundaries where the unknown still breathes.

### Recent Projects

* **FLOWFINDER** — Research framework for testing watershed delineation accuracy across different hydrological analysis tools.
* **Geomockery** — AI-powered tool for generating realistic mock geospatial data for testing and development purposes.
* **Ghost Forest Watcher** — Satellite imagery analysis system using computer vision to monitor forest recovery after wildfire events.
* **ESDA Web Mapping** — Modern framework combining web mapping with exploratory spatial data analysis capabilities.
* **Tilecraft** — AI-assisted CLI tool that generates vector tile pipelines and cartographic styles from natural language descriptions.

### Current Focus Areas

* Agentic workflows for complex spatial analysis automation
* Climate impact visualization for mountain and coastal systems
* Natural language interfaces for cartographic design
* Open source tools for democratizing advanced GIS capabilities
* Ethical AI applications in environmental mapping

### About Me

I'm a geospatial AI consultant, recovering academic, and longtime map nerd based in the U.S. Mountain West. I blend cartographic craft with open-source tech, Buddhist insight, and a commitment to spatial justice.

Let’s make better maps. Together.
