**Dr. Richard Donohue's corner of the geospatial universe** 🗺️

Welcome! I'm Richard, and I spend my days turning messy geographic data into something beautiful and useful. Think of me as a cartographic translator—I help spatial data tell its story, whether that's through elegant web maps, statistical deep-dives, or AI-powered workflows that make the impossible feel routine.

## 🔬 What I Actually Do

### Geospatial Data Science
You know those sprawling datasets full of null values, inconsistent projections, and mysterious column names? I love those. Armed with Python, geopandas, and an unhealthy amount of coffee, I wrangle them into submission and coax out the patterns hiding inside. Whether it's tracking urban sprawl, predicting wildfire risk, or figuring out why your delivery routes are inefficient, I build reproducible workflows that reveal what your data is really trying to tell you.

*Current obsession: Time-series analysis of climate impacts on mountain ecosystems*

### Web Cartography
I create maps for the web that actually work—fast, responsive, and intuitive enough that people want to explore them. Using modern libraries like MapLibre GL JS and Leaflet, I build everything from simple story maps to complex dashboards that integrate real-time data feeds. My background in UX design means I care as much about how your map *feels* as how it looks.

*Latest project: An interactive dashboard tracking ghost forests along the Pacific Coast*

### AI-Assisted Workflows  
This is where things get interesting. I design systems where humans and AI collaborate across the entire mapping pipeline—from data processing to style generation. My flagship project, **Tilecraft**, lets you describe a map style in natural language ("subalpine dusk" or "urban midnight") and generates complete vector tile pipelines with matching cartographic styles. It's like having a very talented intern who never gets tired and loves repetitive tasks.

*Currently experimenting with: AI agents that can debug their own spatial SQL queries*

## 🏔️ The Mountain Connection

Born and raised in Durango, Colorado, I do my best thinking on hiking trails and ski slopes. There's something about mountain landscapes that clarifies complex problems—maybe it's the thin air, or maybe it's just good perspective. My Ph.D. research focused on high-elevation ecosystem changes, and I still find myself drawn to projects that help us understand how our landscapes are shifting.

## 🛠️ Recent Builds

**[FlowFinder](https://github.com/rgdonohue/flowfinder)** → *Watershed delineation accuracy testing framework*  
Because sometimes you need to know if your hydrology algorithms are actually finding the right streams.

**[Geomockery](https://github.com/rgdonohue/geomockery)** → *AI-powered geospatial data generator*  
Creates realistic mock location data for testing. No more using "123 Main St" in your demos.

**[Ghost Forest Watcher](https://github.com/rgdonohue/ghost-forest-watcher)** → *AI forest recovery monitoring*  
Satellite imagery + computer vision to track forest health after wildfires. Still in active development.

**[ESDA Web Mapping](https://github.com/rgdonohue/esda-web-mapping-boilerplate)** → *Modern spatial analysis framework*  
What happens when you combine modern web mapping with statistical rigor.

**[Tilecraft](https://github.com/rgdonohue/tilecraft)** → *AI-assisted cartographic styling*  
The project that convinced me AI and cartography make excellent dance partners.

## 🤖 The AI Philosophy

I'm not building AI to replace cartographers—I'm building it to make us better at what we do. Think of it as having a really good research assistant who can generate code, process data, and even suggest map styles, but still needs human judgment for the important decisions. The goal is to spend less time on tedious data wrangling and more time on the creative, analytical work that actually matters.

## 🎯 Current Interests

- **Agentic workflows** that can handle complex, multi-step spatial analysis
- **Climate impact visualization** with a focus on mountain and coastal systems  
- **Prompt-based cartography** where natural language drives visual design
- **Ethical AI applications** in environmental and social mapping
- **Open source tools** that democratize advanced geospatial capabilities

## 📚 Academic Roots

Ph.D. in Geography, GIS, and Cartography, with research spanning landscape ecology, spatial statistics, and human-environment interactions. I believe in rigorous methodology, reproducible research, and making complex spatial analysis accessible to people who need it most—whether that's a conservation organization, an urban planner, or a startup trying to understand their spatial data.

## 🎨 The Craft

Every map tells a story, and every dataset has patterns waiting to be discovered. I approach each project as a unique challenge that deserves custom solutions, not cookie-cutter templates. Whether you need sophisticated statistical analysis, beautiful interactive visualizations, or AI systems that can scale your spatial workflows, I bring both technical depth and creative vision to the table.

Plus, I actually enjoy debugging spatial queries at 2 AM. (Don't tell my therapist.)
