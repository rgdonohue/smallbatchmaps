**Dr. Richard Donohue's geospatial consultancy**

I specialize in transforming complex geospatial data into meaningful insights and functional web applications. My work combines traditional cartographic principles with modern web technologies and AI-assisted workflows to solve real-world spatial problems.

## What I Do

### Geospatial Data Science
I work with messy, inconsistent geospatial datasets to extract clear insights for decision-making. Using Python, geopandas, and Jupyter notebooks, I build reproducible workflows for spatial analysis, from basic data cleaning to complex predictive modeling. My focus is on exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), time-series modeling, and building scalable data pipelines.

### Web Cartography  
I create interactive web maps and dashboards using modern libraries like MapLibre GL JS, Leaflet, and Mapbox. The emphasis is on performance, usability, and clear visual communication. My background in UX design helps ensure the maps work well for their intended users across all devices.

### AI-Assisted Workflows
I design systems where AI augments human capabilities in geospatial workflows. This includes automated data processing, code generation, and prompt-based cartographic styling. My approach focuses on practical applications that reduce repetitive tasks while maintaining human oversight for important decisions.

## Background

Born and raised in Durango, Colorado, I earned my Ph.D. in Geography, GIS, and Cartography with research focused on high-elevation ecosystem changes. I approach each project as a unique problem requiring custom solutions rather than templated approaches.

I believe in ethical data practices, reproducible research, and making advanced geospatial capabilities accessible to organizations that need them most.

## Recent Projects

**[ESDA Web Mapping](https://github.com/rgdonohue/esda-web-mapping-boilerplate)** - Modern framework combining web mapping with exploratory spatial data analysis capabilities.

**[Tilecraft](https://github.com/rgdonohue/tilecraft)** - AI-assisted CLI tool that generates vector tile pipelines and cartographic styles from natural language descriptions.

## Current Focus Areas

- Agentic workflows for complex spatial analysis automation
- Climate impact visualization for mountain and coastal systems
- Natural language interfaces for cartographic design
- Open source tools for democratizing advanced GIS capabilities
- Ethical AI applications in environmental mapping

## Approach

**Custom Solutions** - Every project gets tailored methodology based on specific requirements and constraints.

**Human-Centered Design** - Maps and applications are designed for actual users with real-world constraints.

**Technical Rigor** - Academic background ensures methodologically sound approaches to spatial analysis.

**Practical Implementation** - Focus on solutions that work reliably in production environments.
